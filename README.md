# Fractal
--------

This drawing of Fractal, more like Mandelbrot Set is done using Sharp on Microsoft Visual Studio. The project consist of already Java code of the drawn Mandelbrot set which I needed to convert it into C# with more additional features like Start, Stop, Color Cycle and so on. <br />
The main function of the code was to color cycle the Colors of the mandelbrot. Thread was used to change the color using various palletes of good looking colors, not random. Save function was also established to save the image on the computer. <br />
A Real Production Application can be made with this codebase if contributors are there to help. Everybody is welcome!!<br /> <br />
